# MSOutlookVBA_GenerateTaskReport
Poorly written, poorly tested Outlook VBA Module that converts Tasks to an HTML summary.   One public function converts Tasks to an HTML list, the other loads that list into an email, ready for sending.  Its under 200 lines of code, so I'm not bothering with installers and all that - I'll create a quick guide on how to install manually (pretty easy).

Only exists because my VP asked for such, and I thought I'd share.
